# Honest CRUD project with Spring Boot and Vue.js

The idea is to test Vue.js to see if it's powerful or not.

Here you'll find a complete stack powered by Spring Boot in the back-end providing first-class CRUD operations in MongoDB.

## Some details

Do not forget to run MongoDB before running the project:

    docker run -itd --name mongodb -p 27017:27017 mongo:3.6.3    

Test the REST web service with Swagger:
